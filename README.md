# Benchmarking-Study-of-Single-Cell-Foundation-Models-for-Cell-Annotation-and-Batch-Integration Across Multiple Datasets

## üìå Overview

This project benchmarks the performance of **Single-Cell Foundation Models (scFMs)** and deep generative models for **cell annotation** and **batch integration** in **single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) analysis**. The study evaluates models like **scBERT, scGPT, scVI, and TotalVI** and compares them with traditional methods such as **SingleCellNet**.

## üìù Abstract

Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) analysis faces challenges related to **dataset generalization** and **batch effects**, which impact biological signal interpretation and cross-dataset comparisons. This study assesses the effectiveness of **scFMs (scBERT & scGPT)** for cell annotation and deep generative models (**scVI & TotalVI**) for batch correction. 

### üîπ Key Findings:
- **scGPT outperforms scBERT and SingleCellNet** in cell annotation, achieving the highest accuracy of **73.4%**.
- **scVI and TotalVI improve batch integration**, reducing technical noise and enhancing biological signal preservation.
- **Future improvements** include fine-tuning models for disease-specific datasets and exploring hybrid approaches.
